    "\n",
    "This variable is selected because it captures the frequency of forming new social connections. We can assign a numerical scale to frequency (e.g., 1 for \"Never,\" 2 for \"Rarely,\" 3 for \"Monthly,\" 4 for \"Weekly,\" and 5 for \"Daily\") so that bigger number represents higher frequency of making new friends. We can use a scatter plot of self-esteem against friend-making frequency with a regression line. This will show if there is a positive trend (self-esteem increasing with frequency).\n",

    "### Analysis:\n",
    "- By performing a Simple Linear Regression, we fit a linear regression model where self-esteem is the dependent variable and friend-making frequency is the independent variable.\n",
    "Self-Esteem = beta0 + beta1 * Friend-Making Frequency + epsilon\n",
    "Where\n",
    "beta0 is the intercept, representing the expected self-esteem level when friend-making frequency is at its lowest and beta1 is the slope, showing how much self-esteem changes with each one-unit increase in friend-making frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis/results and discussion:\n",
    "- The slope (beta1) will be positive, meaning that as the frequency of making new friends increases, self-esteem also increases. It would support the idea that higher social engagement is associated with better self-esteem, which relates back to the research core that \"the potential benefits of connection and community engagement to personal health and well-being\".

    "- Frequent volunteers will report a different and higher positive outlook on life than those who volunteer less often. This supports the idea that community engagement through volunteering leads to a more positive outlook, which relates back to the research core that \"the potential benefits of connection and community engagement to personal health and well-being\".

    "This variable is selected because it provides a quantitative measure (on a 1â€“10 scale) of people's well-being, which is essential in understanding population health and quality of life.

    "- The hypothesis is the interval should be roughly (5, 7). The calculated mean of the data we have is around 6.2 by the way. The interval reflects a moderate to high level of life satisfaction in the population. And this relates back to the research topic about \"personal health and well-being\".\n"
